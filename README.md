# Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer looking to solve real world problems by using software and help others in the process.


## ðŸŽ¯ Projects 

### HireJrDevs 

HireJrDevs is a job board focused on helping junior developers find jobs easily.

It's super difficult to find jobs for entry-level/junior devs which is why I decided to create this website.

I also have a HJD Discord community where people connect and help each other find junior dev jobs.
